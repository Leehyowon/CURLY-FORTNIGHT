## DESCRIPTION

CURLY-FORTNIGHT is a project that want to make official Website of Department for everyone, being more efficient.
You can see it equals a Website of Department of Computer & Science Engineering of Hanyang University.
Most informations of Department are there, and it will be maintained perodically.

## HISTORY

CURLY-FORTNIGHT is based on a website, http://cse.hanyang.ac.kr. Although it was official website of my department, it just was not being managed efficiently. 
When you visit that website, you can see that informations have not changed since 2013.
So students who need informations about department cannot get them. (In fact, I'm the finest known example!)
Therefore we decided to make our own official website, that is in good hands.
This expeditious tool will let you more comfortable!


## INFORMATION
CURLY-FORTNIGHT is a project at Hanyang University, with prof.Shin. We are.. umm.......hoho
