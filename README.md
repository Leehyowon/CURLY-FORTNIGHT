CURLY-FORTNIGHT.  The official Web site of C.S.E, Hanyang Univ.
===============================================================

## DESCRIPTION

CURLY-FORTNIGHT is a project that want to make official Website of Department for everyone, being more efficient.
You can see it equals a Website of Department of Computer & Science Engineering of Hanyang University.
Most informations of Department are there, and it will be maintained perodically.

## HISTORY

CURLY-FORTNIGHT is based on a website, http://cse.hanyang.ac.kr. Although it was official website of my department, it just was not being managed efficiently. When you visit that website, you can see that informations have not changed since 2013.
Therefore we decided to make our own official website, that is in good hands! 

## INFORMATION
CURLY-FORTNIGHT is just a website. So you don't need something to install. You just need internet connected.
